Dear GSEP Students

We are pleased to announce you all that we start the Japanese Kanji Exercise.
Before we start the lesson, we'll have an initial meeting on next Monday, 17th from 3pm at Commons (I6-404).
Please gather at Commons, if you are interested in the class.
We are going to discuss on the best strategy for learning Japanese such as the class schedule, which level Japanese you want to learn ...etc.
We are waiting for your attendance !

Best regards,
GSEP Japanese Kanji Team
